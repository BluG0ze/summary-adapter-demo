Guidelines say people must sit at tables in such venues unless they are paying, leaving or going to the toilet. Jay Bourke, a restaurateur who is involved with the venue, told RTÉ he was \"not happy\" with what had happened Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said the \"vast majority of Irish people have sacrificed a huge amount to help suppress this virus\". He added: \"They've shown huge solidarity. People are rightly sickened by these scenes. \"The reckless actions of a small few can have huge repercussions on everyone else.\" The person who took the video told RTÉ that when he arrived at the venue with his wife, some social distancing measures were being applied. He said tables were being kept 2m apart and food was being served to the tables. However, he said people stopped following the measures at a certain point, and the music was turned up. 'Absolutely mortified' Mr Bourke told RTÉ he was \"absolutely mortified\". But he said having reviewed the CCTV from the venue he believed the footage did not fully reflect what happened. Mr Bourke said footage from inside the premises showed that for the majority of the time people were complying with public health guidelines. He said 51 people had attended a brunch event, which was fully ticketed. He said Berlin D2 was operating at less than 20% capacity at the time, was \"spotlessly clean\" and that food was served, temperature checks and details for contact tracing were taken on arrival and social distancing was maintained. However he said Berlin D2 would stay closed until an internal investigation into the incident is completed. Restaurants Association of Ireland CEO Adrian Cummins described the scenes as \"deplorable and despicable\" and a \"slap in the face to front-line workers who are putting their life on the line during this pandemic\". Mr Cummins said gardaí (Irish police) should take immediate action \"to stamp out this kind of behaviour\". Mr Donnelly's predecessor as health minister, Simon Harris, said the video was a \"kick in the gut\" and a \"middle finger\" to everyone who had suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. \"To everyone who has lost a loved one or been sick with Covid-19, to every frontline worker and to every responsible business owner who have suffered so much. Shameful,\" he wrote. It comes as the number of cases in the Republic of Ireland has risen in recent days. On Saturday, the state reported 200 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, which was the largest daily increase since May. The Irish Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the situation was \"deeply concerning\" and that there were \"multiple clusters\" across the country, as well \"secondary spread\" of the disease. On Sunday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin echoed these concerns, and said the government would \"continue to monitor the situation closely\".\n\ncandidate summaries:\n1.

Looking forward to Friday,\" he tweeted. Trump vows to end 'American carnage' Trump's angry call to arms Full text of Trump's inauguration speech It's unclear whether the president-elect actually wrote the speech himself, but the content was pure Trump: the same populist message that resonated throughout the primaries and the campaign. \"Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another, but we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it back to you, the people,\" he said at the beginning of his remarks. For some on Twitter, it bore an eerie similarity to the Batman villain Bane's speech in The Dark Night Rises, so much so that someone posted a 10-second mash-up of the two. But such snarky reactions, warned Fox News commentator Guy Benson, underestimate how popular his rhetoric is with Trump supporters. \"People panning the speech still don't seem to understand how resonant the 'I will never ignore you' theme has been, and still is,\" he wrote, referencing Trump's many callouts to those who feel left out of American progress. Trump spoke of a country whose citizens had too long been ignored by the coastal elite: \"Their victories have not been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your triumphs. And while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land.\" He painted a picture of a broken and damaged country, dotted with rusting-out factories \"like tombstones\", city streets plagued with \"crime and the gangs, and the drugs that have stolen too many lives,\" and the wealth of the middle class \"ripped from their homes and then redistributed all across the world\". It was an unusually bleak speech for an inaugural address. One democratic strategist called it \"startlingly angry\". Conservatives were more mixed. According to MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, the speech was not intended to follow tradition: \"Donald Trump's speech was not an inaugural address. It was a primal scream aimed at Washington, DC.\" Author Hugh Hewitt called it \"authentic, determined, almost grim\". He wrote, \"I expected more joy, but it cannot be said that POTUS @realDonaldTrump said anything he hasn't said before. He has a plan and it's going to roll out fast.\" Others were sceptical of the breadth of those plans. Trump said the country was poised to \"free the earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow\", as well as \"eradicate from the face of the Earth\" radical Islamic terrorism. Writer Ben Shapiro expressed doubt about Trump's plans to both take power away from DC, and use his position as President to steer trade and create jobs. \"These cannot both be true,\" he wrote. Many also noted that it's easy to campaign as an outsider, railing about America's problems, but harder to lead, when one must find solutions. \"After three months in which Trump is president and it's still the same Washington, that speech is going to seem wildly imprudent,\" wrote Noah Rothman, assistant editor at Commentary Magazine. Commentator Mary Katherine Hahn thinks voters aren't interested in sweeping rhetoric. \"I am unabashedly ideological. The country is not. His message is populist & popular. His opponents dismiss that at their political peril.\" Pollster Frank Luntz said President Trump seemed to pivot, if not in tone then at least in substance: \"President Trump's inaugural speech was the best delivery I've ever seen from him.\" A more well-known conservative kept mum on his opinion. When the Washington Post asked George W Bush what he thought of the speech, he merely replied, \"Good to see you.\" One high-profile Twitter user was an unabashed fan. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke tweeted multiple times in favour of Trump's speech.\n\ncandidate summaries:\n1.

Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action \"sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub\". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would \"have a leg to stand on\" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be \"on the table\" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was \"absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation.\" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said \"legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade\". \"Politically, I think it's extremely unlikely to happen,\" the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. \"They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power.\" Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or 'concordat' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: \"I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account. \"The argument we'll make life difficult for them, it sounds alright on the street, but it's not the reality of intergovernmental relations.\" \"The United Kingdom has to find a way of functioning. \"At the moment, your answers aren't giving me any confidence that there is that structure in place because, if the Welsh Government's argument is, 'we'll see you in court', it's not a very impressive argument either for the continuation of the structure of United Kingdom as a state or the commitment of the government within the United Kingdom to actually work together,\" he added. Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: \"Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate? \"Absolutely not... and it's not just in relation to trade, it's in relation to almost every aspect of government policy. So, that infrastructure needs to be built.\"\n\ncandidate summaries:\n1.

But if a picture ever prompted a thousand words, it was this one. Early rumblings The hash-tags sprung up instantly. Islington, Ms Thornberry's parliamentary seat, became less a borough than an abstraction, furthering a perception, according to Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP for Rochdale, that the Labour Party \"has been hijacked by the north London liberal elite\". The S-word - 15:13 @GuidoFawkes (137,000 followers) ensures @EmilyThornberry (14,400 followers) gets a bigger platform for her views. Tories lick their lips Communities Secretary Eric Pickles was first in with the knife, saying: \"We should have pride in flying the Cross of St George - don't knock the national flag of England.\" Prime Minister David Cameron also appreciated the free hit, saying the Labour MP's actions were \"completely appalling\" and suggesting that she was \"sneering at people who work hard, are patriotic and love their country\". Backpedalling - 18:15 Emily Thornberry told Mail Online: \"It was a house covered in British flags. I've never seen anything like it before.\" \"It had three huge flags covering the whole house. I thought it was remarkable. I've never seen a house completely covered in flags.\" On Friday, Peter Spence of the Daily Telegraph helped her out - perhaps - by highlighting a previous picture she tweeted in 2012. 'Nightmare splash' The BBC's Ross Hawkins noted that the Sun's front page was a \"nightmare\" for Labour, and posed three questions. Damage done - resignation announced 22:30 Shortly after the polls closed in Rochester it was reported that Ms Thornberry had resigned from the shadow cabinet. Throughout Thursday she spoke twice to Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was said to be \"furious\" that the tweet had tripped Labour up on a day when the Tories' loss to UKIP was supposed to dominate the news cycle. Mr Miliband agreed it was best that Ms Thornberry resign. Backlash to the backlash Was Emily Thornberry hard done by? Labour MPs from John Mann to Douglas Alexander seem to think not, having lined up to denounce the tweet and say it was right for Ms Thornberry to resign. Twitter founder Jack Dorsey was asked on Friday if the events surrounding Emily Thornberry's tweets made him frightened at the power of the medium he created. He answered: \"I don't think it's any different from what we've been doing as a humanity - it's just faster.\"\n\ncandidate summaries:\n1. One tweeted picture saw Labour MP Emily Thornberry go from the shadow cabinet to the butt of a twitterstorm, jokes and resignation. Here's how events unfolded, driven by social media.\n2.
